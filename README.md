# Running Django project in Docker container

This is an example, in simplest form, of running Django project in Docker container.

### Steps:
 - Clone this git repo.
 - Build a docker image using the Dockerfile in root directory of this repo
 - start the container
 - go to browser localhost:8800


### Notes:
 - To test the project as you code, instead of copying the current directory in dockerfile, mount it while running container.
